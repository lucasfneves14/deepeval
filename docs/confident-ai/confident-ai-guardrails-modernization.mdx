The **Modernization Guard** is an output guard that analyzes the responses generated by your language model to ensure they are based on the most current and accurate information available. It helps in identifying outdated or obsolete data in the model's outputs, ensuring the information provided is timely and relevant.

:::info
`ModernizationGuard` is only available as an **output guard**.
:::

## Example

```python
from deepeval.guardrails import ModernizationGuard

model_output = "The latest iPhone model was released in 2020."

modernization_guard = ModernizationGuard()
guard_result = modernization_guard.guard(response=model_output)
```

There are no required arguments when initializing the `ModernizationGuard` object. The `guard` function accepts a single parameter `response`, which is the output of your LLM application.

## Interpreting Guard Result

```python
print(guard_result.score)
print(guard_result.score_breakdown)
```

`guard_result.score` is an integer that is `1` if the guard has been breached. The `score_breakdown` for `ModernizationGuard` is a dictionary containing:

- `score`: A binary value (1 or 0), where 1 indicates that outdated content was detected.
- `reason`: A brief explanation of why the score was assigned.

```json
{
  "score": 1,
  "reason": "The response references information from 2020, which is outdated. The latest iPhone model is the iPhone 16, released in 2024."
}
```
