The **Syntax Guard** is an output guard that analyzes the responses generated by your language model to ensure they adhere to proper syntax, formatting, and escaping rules. It helps in identifying issues such as unconverted placeholders, incorrect escaping, punctuation errors, and inconsistent formatting, ensuring the outputs are syntactically correct and well-structured.

:::info
`SyntaxGuard` is only available as an **output guard**.
:::

## Example

```python
from deepeval.guardrails import SyntaxGuard

model_output = "Welcome {{user_name}}! Your order has been placed."

syntax_guard = SyntaxGuard()
guard_result = syntax_guard.guard(response=model_output)
```

There are no required arguments when initializing the `SyntaxGuard` object. The `guard` function accepts a single parameter `response`, which is the output of your LLM application.

## Interpreting Guard Result

```python
print(guard_result.score)
print(guard_result.score_breakdown)
```

`guard_result.score` is an integer that is `1` if the guard has been breached. The `score_breakdown` for `SyntaxGuard` is a dictionary containing:

- `score`: A binary value (1 or 0), where 1 indicates that outdated content was detected.
- `reason`: A brief explanation of why the score was assigned.

```json
{
  "score": 1,
  "reason": "The output contains an unconverted placeholder '{{user_name}}'."
}
```
