import Equation from "@site/src/components/equation";

The **Topical Guard** is an input guard that ensures user inputs adhere to a predefined set of allowed topics. It analyzes the input, compares it against the specified topics, and determines whether the input is relevant or off-topic.

:::info
`TopicalGuard` is only available as an **input guard**.
:::

## Example

```python
from deepeval.guardrails import TopicalGuard

allowed_topics = ["technology", "science", "health"]
user_input = "Can you tell me about the latest advancements in quantum computing?"

topical_guard = TopicalGuard(allowed_topics=allowed_topics)
guard_result = topical_guard.guard(input=user_input)
```

There is 1 required parameter when creating a `TopicalGuard`:

- `allowed_topics`: A list of topics (strings) that are permitted for discussion.

The `guard` function accepts a single parameter `input`, representing the user input to your LLM application.

## Interpreting Guard Result

```python
print(guard_result.score)
print(guard_result.score_breakdown)
```

`guard_result.score` is an integer that is `1` if the guard has been breached. The `score_breakdown` for `TopicalGuard` a list of dictionaries, each containing:

- `topic`: The allowed topic against which the input was compared.
- `score`: A binary value (0 or 1), where 0 indicates the input aligns with the topic, and 1 indicates it does not.
- `reason`: An explanation of why the input does or does not align with the topic.

```json
[
  {
    "topic": "technology",
    "score": 0,
    "reason": "The input discusses advancements in quantum computing, which falls under the technology topic."
  },
  {
    "topic": "science",
    "score": 0,
    "reason": "Quantum computing is a scientific field, aligning with the science topic."
  },
  {
    "topic": "health",
    "score": 1,
    "reason": "The input does not pertain to health-related matters."
  }
]
```

## How Is it Calculated?

The final guard score (which ultimately determines a breach) is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Topical Guard Score} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if no topic matches} \\ 0 & \text{if at least one topic matches} \end{cases}" />

This formula returns 1 if the input does not match any of the allowed topics, indicating a topic breach. It returns 0 if the input matches at least one allowed topic, indicating no breach.
